			<h1>My Technology</h1>
		<div class ="bodylink">
			<p>I started off with a desktop PC around 2005. 
			I remember it had a <a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Intel Pentium" target ="_blank">Intel Pentium</a> processor and only 128MB RAM. 
			It was an exciting year for me.
			Around 2007, after a long struggle, 
			I bought my first cellphone, which was a 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Nokia 3110 classic<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#n3110">here</a> for details.</span></span> with 2G GPRS capabilities. 
			It was just an average phone, nothing too exciting.  
			After coming to Australia, 
			I change my phone to 
			<span class ="tooltip1">BlackBerry Pearl 9100<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#bp">here</a> for details.</span></span>. Again it was okay, nothing to brag about.
			Things changed around 2011, when I bought my first laptop. 
			It was from an online shopping website and was an 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Asus N53JQ<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#an53">here</a> for details.</span></span> full HD with 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Intel i7" target ="_blank">Intel i7</a>  first generation processor and 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=nVidia" target ="_blank">nVidia</a>  graphics card.
			It had brushed aluminium casing, which looked so cool. I mainly used it to play games.</p>
			<p>Next piece of tech. that I bought was a smartphone. It was an 
			<span class ="tooltip1">HTC One X<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#onex">here</a> for details.</span></span>. It was my gateway to the android world.
			I messed around with it like rooting and installing unofficial ROMs. 
			After losing that phone in a shopping center, I got upgraded to 
			<span class ="tooltip1">HTC One M7<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#m7">here</a> for details.</span></span>, which claimed the "Hotest Phone of the Year" award.
			I played around with it even more. Then I bought 
			<span class ="tooltip1">HTC One M8<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#m8">here</a> for details.</span></span>. 
			I messed around with that phone so much that I bricked it. But, the store couldn't figure out what was wrong with it,
			so they just gave me a new phone.</p>
			<p>After being a loyal consumer of 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=HTC" target ="_blank">HTC</a>, I decided to try 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Samsung" target ="_blank">Samsung</a>  because 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=HTC" target ="_blank">HTC</a> 's new flagship wasn't exciting at all. So I started with 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Samsung Galaxy S6<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#s6">here</a> for details.</span></span>. 
			But I messed things up while selecting the model that I wanted. Thought I had selected 
			<span class ="tooltip1">S6 Edge<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#s6">here</a> for details.</span></span>, but unfortunately was normal 
			<span class ="tooltip1">S6<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#s6">here</a> for details.</span></span> model. After using that, I bought 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Samsung Galaxy S7<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#s7">here</a> for details.</span></span> outright. Then I decided to give 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=HTC" target ="_blank">HTC</a> another chance and bought 
			<span class ="tooltip1">HTC U11<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#u11">here</a> for details.</span></span>, which was just a mistake. It was just the worst and of poor quality. I just gave up on 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=HTC" target ="_blank">HTC</a> then and bought 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Samsung Galaxy S9+<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#s9">here</a> for details.</span></span>, that I intend to keep for many years.</p>
			<p>The next big thing that happened in my life was the new laptop. It was on a great deal at 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=JB Hifi" target ="_blank">JB Hifi</a> and I was quick to get my hands on it. Its a 
			<span class ="tooltip1">HP Omen 15-dc0101tx<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#omen">here</a> for details.</span></span> gaming laptop. It has 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Intel i7 8th Gen" target ="_blank">Intel i7 8th Gen.</a> processor with 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=nVidia GTX 1050" target ="_blank">nVidia GTX 1050</a> graphics card, 16GB RAM and 250GB NVME M.2 and 1TB 7200rpm HDD. 
			I've already upgraded the secondary hard drive to 1TB 
			<a href ="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=Samsung SSD" target ="_blank">Samsung SSD</a>.</p>
			<p>Recent piece of tech. that I'm playing around with is a 
			<span class ="tooltip1">Raspberry Pi 3 B+<span class ="tip1_text">Click <a href ="details.html#pi3">here</a> for details.</span></span>, which is part of my TAFE course.</p>
			<h4>That's been my journey in the <span class = "h4">technical world</span> so far.</h4>
